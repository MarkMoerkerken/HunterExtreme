I choose this license option because It gives the person freedom to do mistly 
what they want with the source code.  This project was never intended to make
me money so allowing other people to use and change the source code for there 
own purpose never really bothered me. The license also make me not responisble 
for anything bad that can happen with the program.  So it is a use at your risk
application that if something goes wrong I will nver be indented for.
